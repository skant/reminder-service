----------
**Wow, cool! Where do I start?**

 - First, you would need a Twitter account. 
 - After that follow
   http://twitter.com/laterr bot on twitter. 
 - Last, but very **important**, please set you timezone correctly in Twitter: **settings** to receive timely reminders. 

**laterr** will follow you back in a minute or two and that's it.
You are all ready to set your reminders by sending a direct message to **laterr** on twitter


To send a direct message to laterr use the following format:

> d laterr *Reminder Message

You will recieve the reminder back as a direct message and/or email, SMS. etc (depending on you twitter settings for direct messages)

----------
**Why direct messages ?**

We want to ensure your privacy and that no one, including your friends, should be able to see any of your reminders.

*Imagine your girlfriend finds out that you are going to give her flowers this Friday => FAIL :)*

----------
**Gothca! Is there any kind of restriction on reminders?**

Everybody is entitled to free speech. So you can set any kind of reminders you want. If laterr doesn't understand your reminder, it will regretfully tell you that.

But laterr also needs some time to rest and sort out all your reminders, so kindly refrain from setting reminders that has a time
difference of 5 minutes or lesslike: "Remind me in 5 minutes to go to bed". I am guessing you won't need reminders for such short durations :)

----------
**What's keeping us busy ?**

Yes, we know this ain't perfect . But we are surely trying to get close. We are working on understanding more human friendly language.
Some of the features we will be supporting in future releases:

1) Remind me to pay bill in 10 days
result: "Hey, time to pay bill"

2) Remind me to check my secondary mail every 2 days
result: "Check your secondary mail." - (Recurring reminder every 2 days.)

3) Pay phone bill on 2nd of every month
result: "Pay phone bill." - (This message is sent on 2nd of every month.)

...and a lot more.


Keep using the service. That will keep us going and there is more NLP to come.
